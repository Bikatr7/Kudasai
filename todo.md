----The I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I'M DOING Edition~~
Work on making docx_handler work, need to be able to use docx files as input - Likely just gonna pull the images out, replace with text and put back in later, would need to adjust prompt building to account for this.

The thing is, I don't really see a way to do this. We'd extract the text, but since we're translating it, we'd have to put it back in the same place, and I don't see how that's possible cause of structure changes.
