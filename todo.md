----for next version---
Work on making docx_handler work, need to be able to use docx files as input - Likely just gonna pull the images out, replace with text and put back in later, would need to adjust prompt building to account for this

~~strip out the unneeded spacy, since we moved it all to kairyou and everyone uses the auto pair anyways we don't need it and can speed up startup~~
