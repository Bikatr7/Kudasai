move api keys to appdata instead of user folder

Work on making docx_handler work, need to be able to use docx files as input - Likely just gonna pull the images out, replace with text and put back in later, would need to adjust prompt building to account for this

Make sure archival has debug_log (not sure why the fuck it doesn't)
